# js-converted-to-cpp
I took the *js-program-01* program and converted it to c++. 

It was an exercise to see how much C++ knowledge I had retained after reviewing some material. 

Even though the program had been completed in another language, it was a tougher to convert than I had guessed.

In the end though, I am glad I did this as it helped me understand Scope better, in C++ and JavaScript as well. JavaScript seems to be a bit easier to finish programs but C++ seems more logically designed and more readable to me, which in my opinion is very important. I'm officially a "fan" of C++!
